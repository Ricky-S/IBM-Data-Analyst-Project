### Phase of SDLC

1 Planning

2 Design

3 Development

4 Testing

5 Deployment

6 Maintenance


- **Planning**
- Requirement gathering
- Creation of SRS (Software Requirements Specification)
- **Design**
- Development of architecture
- Creation of design documentation
- **Development**
- Actual coding phase
- **Testing**
- Identification and fixing of bugs
- **Deployment**
- Release of code to production environment
- **Maintenance**
- Collection of stakeholder feedback
- Identification of issues and bugs
- Suggestion of code enhancements

Each phase represents a distinct stage in the software development process, following a sequential order from planning through to maintenance. This is a fundamental concept in software engineering that helps organize and structure the development process.
