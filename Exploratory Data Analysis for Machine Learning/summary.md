# Machine Learning and Deep learning

Supervised Learning: 
- has a target column. 
- Make Predictions on unseen data.
- Classification: Predicting a category.

Unsupervised Learning:
- No target column.
- Find structure in the data
- Clustering: Grouping similar data points together.

Deep Learning:
- Computer vision
- NLP

**Machine Learning Workflow:**

- Problem Statement: What problem are you trying to solve?
- Data Collection: Collect data from various sources.
- Data exploration and Preprocessing: how should you clean the data so your model can use it.
- Modeling: Build a model to solve the problem.
- Validation: Did I solve the problem? How well does the model perform?
- Decision making and deployment: communicate the results to stakeholders. Put the model into production.
